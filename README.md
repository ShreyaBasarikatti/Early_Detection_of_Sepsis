# Early_Detection_of_Sepsis
''' Sepsis is a potentially fatal medical disorder that needs to be identified and treated right away to avoid fatalities. It must be quickly identified and treated in order to stop it from developing into severe sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Sepsis remains a significant problem for doctors despite advancements in medical technology and treatment methods. The beginning of the disease has been successfully predicted by machine learning models in recent years, but due to their black-box character, it is challenging to interpret these predictions and comprehend the underlying illness mechanisms.
