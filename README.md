# Early_Detection_of_Sepsis
Sepsis is a potentially fatal medical disorder that needs to be identified and treated right away to avoid fatalities. It must be quickly identified and treated in order to stop it from developing into severe sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Sepsis remains a significant problem for doctors despite advancements in medical technology and treatment methods. The beginning of the disease has been successfully predicted by machine learning models in recent years, but due to their black-box character, it is challenging to interpret these predictions and comprehend the underlying illness mechanisms.

# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
To gain a better understanding of the data and identify important features for sepsis prediction, we perform exploratory data analysis.

# Result
The output shows the results of the LIME algorithm applied to the early detection of sepsis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. LIME provides a way to explain the predictions of the XGBoost model used in the sepsis detection task.In conclusion, the LIME algorithm provides an effective method to explain the predictions of XGBoost models for early detection of sepsis using XAI. The results of the LIME algorithm can help clinicians to understand the important features that contribute to sepsis detection and can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.
